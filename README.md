## üñ•Ô∏è Online IDE Exam Platform

This application provides a platform for conducting exams online using an integrated IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for code-based questions. Students can write code in the IDE, view the result/output, and save their responses. The platform is designed to ensure exam integrity and convenience for both students and instructors.

### üåü Features

- **Question Management**: Instructors can add, edit, and delete questions for exams.
- **Integrated IDE**: Each question has a dedicated IDE where students can write code.
- **Result Box**: Next to the IDE, there's a result box that displays the output of the code.
- **Auto Save**: Students can save their code and result by clicking on the save button.
- **Full-Screen Exam Mode**: When accessing the exam, the browser enters full-screen mode to minimize distractions.
- **Automatic Session Termination**: If the exam duration elapses or the student closes the browser, the session is terminated automatically.
- **Student Registration**: Students are prompted to provide personal information (name, matricule, major, specialization, session, course code, semester) and consent to exam rules before starting the exam.
- **Admin Portal**: Instructors have access to an admin portal where they can manage questions, view student responses, and analyze exam data.
